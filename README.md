# How to use this

The only interesting thing here is the build_hw file. Execute it with
the assignment number as the only argument and it will automatically
run pdflatex on it and open up the pdf file for you afterwards.

Note that your latex file must be named hw#.tex or the script will
not be able to find it.

Example: `./build_hw 5`
